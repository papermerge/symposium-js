class Breadcrumb extends Collection {
    /**
    Breadcrumb indicates the current browsing’s location
    within a navigational hierarchy.

    Example:

    / Home / My Documents / Payments / Invoices

    Breadcrumb model is represented by an collection of Folder models.
    The leftmost folder in the breadcrumb is called root Folder (in example
    above /Home/ folder is the root folder).
    The rightmost folder in thr breadcrumb is called parent Folder (in example
    above /Invoices/ is parent folder).
    If breadcrumb is regarded as an array then folders closer to
    the root have lower indexes:

    Breadcrumb:               / Home / My Documents / Payments / Invoices

    Collection node indexes:  undefined / 0 / 1 / 2
    Notice that there is no node for root folder, which means that
    breadcrumb with 4 items (see example above), collection will
    have 3 folders:
        Folder(title=My Documents) - with index 0
        Folder(title=Payments) - with index 1
        Folder(title=Invoices) - with index 2

    First item in breadcrumb (My Documents) is accessible via first() method.
    Last item in breadcrumb (Invoices) is accessible via last() method.

    change_parent(folder) {
        /**
        Change breadcrumb's parent folder.

        From collection of nodes point of view, this means to set given as
        argument folder the last one in collection.

        If given folder is `undefined` - means the whole node's collection
        will be emptied. From user point of view - he/she chose to navigate
        to the root folder.

        If given folder is not equal to any of the nodes present in collection
        then - it means that use chose to navigate one folder "deeper".

        If given folder matches one of the nodes from `this.nodes` collection
        it means that user clicked on intermediary navigation path on the
        breadcrumb - in this case we need to throw away whatever breadcrumb
        elements were after given folder.
